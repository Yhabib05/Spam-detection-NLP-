# Spam-detection-NLP-
A spam detection machine learning model 

## Overview
This project implements a spam detection system using three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree classifiers. The project follows the steps of data preprocessing, vectorization, model training, and evaluation.

## Future Improvement
- Implementing a web interface, or a python interface to give it a mail and it detects if It's a spam or not.

- Connecting the model to your gmail, and it detects for you.
